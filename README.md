## ML-Learning
机器学习-张伟楠 
个人学习及思考

- Common conceptual differences
  
  - Parametric vs Non-Parametric Models
  
  - Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning vs Semi-supervised Learning

- KNN
  
  - The KNN algorithm completes the image classification problem of the MNIST dataset

  - Classification Effect of KNN on Gaussian Dataset (sklearn)

  - Use KNN to complete the regression mission - color style transfer

- Linear Regression

- Logistic Regression

- Bilinear model 
  
  - Matrix Factorization (MF)
  
  - Factorization Machines (FM)

- Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons 
  
  - Image classification tasks (CNN)

  - Color Transfer Based on VGG Network

- Recurrent Neural Network
  
  - Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU)

- Support Vector Machine
 
  - SMO solves for SVM
    
    - Linear

    - Non-Linear 

- Decision Tree

- Ensemble Learning and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees

  - Bagging and Random forest
    
  - Stacking

  - AdaBoost

  - XGBOOST 

- K-means Clustering

  - K-means 

- Principal Component Analysis
  
  - PCA-Feature decomposition

- Probability Graph Models
