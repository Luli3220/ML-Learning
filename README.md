## ML-Learning
机器学习-张伟楠 
个人学习及思考

- Common conceptual differences
  
  - Parametric vs Non-Parametric Models
  
  - Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning vs Semi-supervised Learning

- KNN
  
  - The KNN algorithm completes the image classification problem of the MNIST dataset

  - Classification Effect of KNN on Gaussian Dataset (sklearn)

  - Use KNN to complete the regression mission - color style transfer

- Linear Regression
  
  - Linear regression (analytic solution) predicts house prices

  - Linear regression (gradient descent) predicts house prices(SGD VS GD)

  - Effect of learning rate on gradient decline

- Logistic Regression
   
   - Logistity's prediction and its model evaluation（AUC）

- Bilinear model 
  
  - Recommendations by Movie Ratings (Matrix Factorization（MF）)
  
  - Click prediction based on Factorization Machines (FM)

- Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons 
  
  - Point classification problem based on multilayer perceptron

  - Point classification problem based on multilayer perceptron(Pytorch)
  
- Convolutional neural networks
  
  - Image classification tasks (CNN)

  - Color Transfer Based on VGG Network

- Recurrent Neural Network
  
  - Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU)

- Support Vector Machine
 
  - SMO solves for SVM
    
    - Linear

    - Non-Linear 

- Decision Tree
   
  - C4.5

- Ensemble Learning and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees

  - Bagging and Random forest
